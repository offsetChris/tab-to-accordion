# tab-to-accordion
UX pattern of switching from desktop tabs to vertical accordion without duplicate markup.

## Sass design pattern
Inspired by Brad Frost's Atomic design and BEM principles, named for a local landmark in MN. 

**Bits**
Bits are small repeatable patterns like buttons, section designations, etc. 

**Pieces**
Similar to Atomic design's components. Small assemblages of bits that make simple UX patterns.

**Whole**
Large, page layout patterns (probably not used in this example)
